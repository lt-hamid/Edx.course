Web programming with javascript and python.
Web programming with HTML, CSS, SCSS, Javascript course. 
In this course I'm assigned a project with the below specifications: Generally speaking, in this project0, I'm supposed to design a personal webpage about myself, one of my interests, or any other topic of my choice. 

The subject matter, look and feel, and design of the site are entirely up to me, subject to the following requirements: The website must contain at least four different .html pages, and it should be possible to get from any page on website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks. 

*The website must include at least one list (ordered or unordered), at least one table, and at least one image. 
*The website must have at least one stylesheet file. The stylesheet(s) must use at least five different CSS properties, and at least five different types of CSS selectors. 
*You must use the #id selector at least once, and the .class selector at least once. The stylesheet(s) must include at least one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens. 

*I must use Bootstrap 4 on your website, taking advantage of at least one Bootstrap component, and using at least two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstrap’s grid model. 
*My stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance. 
*In README.md, include a short writeup describing your project, what’s contained in each file, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about my project.
